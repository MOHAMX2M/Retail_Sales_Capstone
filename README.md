End-to-End Retail Performance and Behavioral Analytics

This project was developed for RetailNova Inc., a retailer facing challenges with rapid online growth, high product returns, customer churn, and uneven profitability. The goal was to deliver data-driven insights into sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional/store efficiency.

The work followed a three-phase methodology:

Data Cleaning & EDA (Python): Structured raw datasets, handled missing values, outliers, and created derived features like profit, age groups, and tenure.

SQL Analysis: Built a relational database, imported cleaned data, designed queries to calculate key business metrics (revenue, profit, returns, customer segmentation), and answered 10 strategic business questions.

Interactive Dashboards (Tableau): Developed dashboards to visualize sales trends, customer insights, product performance, and return patterns, enabling clear interpretation and decision-making.

Key findings included fluctuating revenue with a sharp April 2025 decline, high return rates in specific categories (Home & Kitchen, Apparel), underperformance in certain stores and regions, and low engagement from younger (<25) and older (65+) customer segments. Recommendations ranged from strengthening online channels and improving product quality to age-focused marketing campaigns and regional benchmarking.

This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates the integration of Python, SQL, and Tableau for advanced retail analytics, supporting business intelligence and strategic decision-making.
